            "Usually people defer to Beijing or Shanghai to learn about contemporary
            China,” said Philippe Werner-Wildner, a Chilean professor who initially
            proposed the basis of a GBA-themed program in 2019. “The Greater Bay
            Area is where much of the future focus is now.”</p>

        <p class="write-up">Philippe, a Wuhan University PhD graduate who spent 5 years in Wuhan had
            planned to bring delegations of South Americans to Guangzhou and
            Shenzhen, with partner organization, Guangzhou-based, Greater Bay
            Academy. <br>

            With study tour plans scrapped due to the pandemic, South China University
            of Technology eventually opted to provide the academic component of the
            GBA program online last month in October, which just completed its first
            round ever. <br>

            Jon Santangelo, founder of Greater Bay Academy, who designed the course
            curriculum alongside SCUT, said, “Our program is centred around Chinese
            innovation with the GBA as the backdrop.” <br>

            “We’re honoured to partner with SCUT as they’re a top-ranking university that
            is well regarded in China,” said Jon.</p>

            SCUT and Greater Bay Academy together were planning to host their first
            delegation of visiting international students in 2020. The planned study tour
            was in Guangzhou and Shenzhen in Guangdong province, the first region of
            the People’s Republic of China to open to foreign businesses in 1979. <br>

            Today, Guangdong is the country’s most affluent province with approximately
            60,000 factories producing 30% of China’s exports and also 30% of the
            world’s textiles and toys.. Its capital, Guangzhou, and tech hub, Shenzhen,
            two of China’s top four metropolises (Beijing and Shanghai being the other
            two) are closely networked with GBA’s nine other key cities.</p>
